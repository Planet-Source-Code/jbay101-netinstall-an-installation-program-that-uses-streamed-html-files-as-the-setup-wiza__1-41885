### Description

This program (<50KB) is a full dynamic setup program. It loads the setup wizard over the internet from a collection of html/text files on a webserver. The advantage? A VERY small program can be downloaded very quickly to install a large program, and the wizard itself can be truly multimedia - it can use animations, javascript, flash etc. best of all, the installation can be easily updated without having to release a new installation program. Take a look - I have included a sample installation (a very basic one). NOTE: my web server has a 100mb PER MONTH bandwidth limit. f online fails, please try offline test.
